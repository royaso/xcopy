# dreamhost

There is currently a page on the Dreamhost wiki <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Web.py">for web.py</a>.   The instructions there will work, just give plenty of time for FastCGI to be enabled.  Dreamhost's panel application says 10 minutes but it may take much longer.

For a <a href="http://svn.natalian.org/projects/todo/.htaccess">.htaccess</a> that works.

Dreamhost imposes a limit of 100MB of virtual memory on your apps. See the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/browse_thread/thread/635e005516f8be90/7945b3f8b032aa2e#7945b3f8b032aa2e">post by Deepak Sarda to the mailing list</a> for more information.
