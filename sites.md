# Sites that use web..py

web.py was originally published while Aaron Swartz worked at [reddit.com][20], where the site used it as it grew to become one of the top 1000 sites according to Alexa and served millions of daily page views. "It's the anti-framework framework. web.py doesn't get in your way," explained founder Steve Huffman. (The site was rewritten using other tools after being acquired by Cond√© Nast.)
